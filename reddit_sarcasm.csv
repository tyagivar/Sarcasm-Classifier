27,"""Because you speeding does not directly result in a crash statistically.  Its hard to directly say that the act of going over the speed limit is what causes the crashes.  The US DOT did a study on data between 2005 and 2007 that found 8.4% of all crashes were because the driver was driving ""too fast for conditions"", and another 4.9% were ""too fast for curve"". (http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/us-crashcause.pdf)  Neither of which can be considered outright speeding, so the percentage of crashes due to simply going over the speed limit is even below that (a virginia study found it to be about 2.9% in their state - http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/va-crash07.pdf).    Now one could say, ""Well its more than 0% so its worth enforcing a speed limit.""  And I agree that there needs to be some sort of limit, but it needs to be a speed which is correct for the road.  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, would you not say the speed limit is too slow for the road?  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, that means 10% isnt which is really the majority cause of these speed related crashes, difference of speed of those involved.  So if the majority of traffic is going over the speed limit, do we limit the majority of people and continue to write tickets to those who dont obey, or do we raise the speed limit to prevent drivers from going slower than the pack?  Well we continue to write tickets of course because its a great source of income for police departments! /s"""

The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation.[citation needed] Japan's 1990s recession continued. This recession was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low inflation and low unemployment) had already ceased in East Asia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The recession wasn't as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions.

719,"""&gt; I don't believe for one second that Biz was not showing effort. That dude Breeds effort. He constantly is getting as cut as possible and is always training and always gets backed by teammates as a hard worker.  How many Hornets practices have you watched?  How many scrimmages?  How much tape?  How much have you talked to the trainers?  I'm gonna go ahead and say less than Clifford.    &gt; Being top 10 in defense doesn't mean he doesn't plays undersized line ups that lost us 4th Q leads....  I remember line ups of Kemba/Roberts/PJ/Marv/maxiell every single person is undersized in that group.  Bottom line he subbed defense for offense in the 4th and that resulted in losses.  You have to deal the cards you're dealt.  We don't have a very tall team, so we're going to be playing undersized ball a lot.  I don't think the lineup you mentioned really saw that much floor time.  PJ didn't play very often.  When we did put that lineup (or variations of that lineup) on the court, it was to score points.  The team is much, much better at defense than offense.  More often than not the reasons why we lost games were due to offensive problems rather than defensive problems.  Roberts, PJ, and Marvin are all better from 3 than the other guys at their positions (or at least were before Mo came).  They're still not good, but they're the best option to put points on the board.    &gt; Cliff foolishly stuck with his guns ... while our young players matured and needed more touches which they didn't get this year  1. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Clifford had no reason to go into the season with the assumption that Al would regress so much.  Had Al been healthy, the plan would have worked and we'd be in the playoffs.    2. Our team is built around Big Al on both offense and defense.  Our entire defensive strategy comes from a scheme Clifford devised to hide Al's weaknesses by focusing on team help D.  The players we signed were meant to compliment big Al (PJ, Marvin, Roberts, Mo, Lance, etc) and fit the system.    3. You can't easily change your identity mid- or late-season.  Players need time to learn new roles, new gameplans, and new schemes.  Making a radically new system is not something you can introduce overnight.  A lot of time, money, and talent is invested into the Big Al system (which has proven to be successful before).  When a tire goes flat on your car, the car naturally won't work as well as before.  That doesn't mean that you need to buy a new car, only get new tires.  We've had a lot of flats this year.  4. Which young players?  MKG got more playing time and lots more touches and shots on offense than ever before.  Zeller got loads more playing time and even became the regular starter.  I'm not sure you can honestly use PJ and ""matured"" yet in the same sentence.    &gt; He actually threw MKG under the bus very hard recently and it pissed me off.    ???? Clifford said [MKG might be Hornets most important player.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588732257600458752)  ""[He has a contagious competitiveness about him....When he wasn't on the floor I didn't like it](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733044938375168).""

I refer those people to the feat found in totally-fair-and-not-broken-ACG which gives the Oracle Divine Grace, as the Paladin ability (add CHA to all saves in addition to their base stat), so lack of this option actually makes WIS *weaker* than CHA for the Oracle's purposes.  Another option is to play a Lore Shaman instead of a Lore Oracle. Aside from being WIS based out the gate, Lore Shaman gets a very good reason to grab a non-trivial INT score as well which feels appropriate here.

They thought one of the main themes of the movie was that Love literally transcended space and time, which is obviously false and not what Interstellar was about.    The movie is a paradox within a paradox - Cooper fulfills the inner paradox when he sends the messages while in the tesseract, and future humans fulfill the outer paradox in some distant time when they have the technology to ""send back"" the black hole and wormhole and create the tesseract.  Future humans would have known it was something they needed to do because it already happened, in the same way Cooper did.  Of course, you either think this kind of paradox is possible or you think it's impossible (hence it being a paradox).  Either way, I think it's very interesting.    IMO, people who think the point of the movie is that *Love* transcends time and space are really missing a **huge** part of it.

For centuries the Marches on either side of the boundary was an area of mixed allegiances, **where families or clans switched which country or side they supported as suited their family interests at that time**, and lawlessness abounded. Before the personal union of the two kingdoms under James, **the border clans would switch allegiance between the Scottish and English crowns depending on what was most favourable for the members of the clan**. For a time a powerful local clan dominated a region on the border between England and Scotland. It was known as the Debatable Lands and neither monarch's writ was heeded.""

Let's count the ways society ""Does not fall over itself to help women"", shall we? We have Affirmative Action (Or as some call it in a solipsistic manner, ""Positive Discrimination"", as if there could be such a thing), we have the general aforementioned leniency in sentencing that you conveniently ignored, we have woman-only gyms and other ""Safe Spaces"" for women to congregate and socialize outside of interacting with men (While the same concept for men was demonized as sexist and discriminatory only a couple decades ago), and the ""Listen and Believe"" line being pushed on college campuses that has now led to a complete violation, yet again, of Title IX in their zealotry to ""Protect the Womynz"", which was done at their behest, I might add.  None of these benefits are extended to men. In fact, given the statistics on [health research alone,](http://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx) with research expenditures for Breast Cancer at $715 Million, Uterine Cancer at $40 Million, and Women's Health at a whopping total of $3,891,000,000 the amount spent on any field remotely benefitting men looks like a pittance, with Prostate Cancer at $284 Million, and absolutely zilch, zip, nada for either Testicular Cancer or Men's Health. We are largely left to fend for ourselves in the private sector for our healthcare research, which if you are familiar with anything in regards to research and funding, depending on private backers only means research is agonizingly slow without public funds. When the grand total of public healthcare costs in major gender-specific health issues ($4,576,000,000 for women, versus $40,000,000 for men) do not even come down to men even getting 1% of what is spent on women's health issues, and yet you claim that ""Society does not fall over itself to help women"", it makes it perfectly clear who the ignorant one here is.

It basically determines the result--if a law only needs a rational basis, it will be held to be constitutional; if a law must be justified under strict scrutiny (a compelling state interest accomplished using the least intrusive means available) the laws are generally unconstitutional.  There have been two outliers--Japanese internment camps and travel to Cuba where laws have survived strict scrutiny.  The US paid reparations for the former and history will judge us poorly for the latter.  Where a law disproportionately impacts either a fundamental right or a ""suspect"" class (race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and in some states sexual orientation) the courts will use strict scrutiny and all these laws appear doomed.

I'm not a building designer or an engineer or some shit. I get into arguments with people often about this on both sides, and they both piss me off.

To me its like two sides of the same coin, just people picking one side and not thinking critically about it. I can't tell you if WTC 7 was a controlled demolition or if there were explosives in the buildings or Larry Silverstein had anything to do with it. I have watched some youtube videos and news stories though, just like 99% of people who argue for or against the conspiracy.

It blew my mind.   Anyway I just wanted to say please don't think all conspiracy people are insane, to me its just about being open minded. Questioning these things is healthy, being an asshole isn't. And to add another conspiracy to your list there is the disinformation conspiracy, that the CIA and the powers that be create a lot of the conspiracy theories that exist by spreading false info, which is thrown up on /r/conspiracy and other forums which then discredits those places of discussion, which I personally believe is fairly likely.

Black people were strongly encouraged by white colonial societies to emigrate there where they eventually managed to gain a foothold, declare independence, and proceeded to brutally subjugate the locals for the next 150 years. All while propped up by the United States.  This segregationist society (Americans vs natives) persisted throughout most of the 20th century culminating in a coup and eventual civil war which lasted over a decade during which there was extensive child soldiering, slavery, rape and widespread pillaging and indiscriminate murder of civilians along other war crimes.   That's thankfully over now and Libera has emerged as only the fourth poorest country in the entire world.

On top of that, for the first 6 years he started his business, he took 50% of his salary and invested heavily on Proctor &amp; Gamble, which is where the bulk of their wealth comes from now.  I was talking with him recently and he said he owns around 300,000 shares.  I picked up my smartphone to Google Finance ""PG"".  I guess he knew what I was doing, because he looked at me and said, ""Its around $24,000,000, Rath.""  The really fucking nutty part is that their dividend payouts have been around $0.64 a share, which means for the past few years he's been getting another $190,000~ every 3 months.  So honestly what's $30,000 to him?  Its like two weeks of dividend payouts.  I honestly don't know why he didn't just buy it outright for her, but I guess he wants to instill some level of responsibility into her, especially since he came up dirt poor.  I feel sorry for whoever marries her, but at least they'll be comforted by all the cash they'll inherit, since he has four children and they're all getting an equal split of the family assets.

The reason that you can't download more than 4 GB at once is because when you download it, the RAM goes from your download folder into your vDIMM slots (also known as vRAM, v stands for virtual). Check the type of GPU (Geometric Programmable (RAM) Unifier) and if your computer only has 2 GB of vRAM, it will only let you download 2GB at once. You can still download the 4 GB package but it will have to download 2 GB twice, not 4 GB all at once. You can download as much RAM as your SSD (Selective Sender (of) Data) can hold. Just make sure you do not download it to your HDD (Handy Data Deleter) as your RAM will get deleted immediately. And don't download too much since it will overflow your computer's mainframe and cause your Optical Drive to take up too many stream processors which makes your heatsink start to float and that will make your PC's Motherboard IO plate to fall off, thus ruining your whole PC.

It's hard to say anything cuz I haven't seen your build yet, but I would assume it is a light weight build (cuz all of my hovers are heavy and I haven't seen much of this problem).  The problem is hover's force application is proportional to the weight, to prevent hovers from sending craft flying to the moon, so there are various problems when the mechanic glitches up on light hover. One of it is the inability to turn quickly because there is not enough force. Another is being randomly flinged to the sky. If you suffer from this symptoms, try adding weight to your bot...  Except then it would make your hover crawl as slow as a turtle.

I have 2 daughters, and I would not have any problem letting her teach them.  I am sure that she was not chatting porn to the kids.  They, evil fuckers that they are, went out and found it on their own and wrecked her life for fun.  Many years ago in my school, they fired a teacher because the cops raided an adult book store where folks were using a glory hole between two booths, and he was there at the book store during the raid.  We never knew if he was involved in the glory hole activities, but it didn't make any difference; the school district fired him immediately.  We kids raised hell on his behalf, signed petitions and stuff we thought might help, but it didn't help.  I don't know what's next.

What would have happened to his children if Robert had found out what Bran saw? He couldn't take that risk. Yes, maybe Jaime doesn't care very much for his children, but I don't think he wants them to die. And if it's them or Bran... what would you do in that situation?  Cersei torments people because she likes it. Jaime has done horrible things but didn't like doing them. I don't think he took pleasure in tossing Bran.  This is what is interesting about Jaime. On the surface he looks like a tropey prince-charming-esque knight in shining armor. Dig a little deeper and you see the unsavory traits of his character. Dig even deeper and you see that he is a good person at heart.   EDIT: is there any unincestuous sex he could have had with his sister? /s"""
